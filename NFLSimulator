## Main arguments used for predicting scores are Standard Relative Strength, Points Per Game, Points Allowed Per Game, DVOA (From Football Outsiders), and Variance (From Football Outsiders)

# Method below is for putting all the team information in a single dictionary

def teambuilder(team, srs, pf, pa, dvoa, var):
    return {'Team': team, 'Standard Relative Strength': srs, 'Points For': pf, 'Points Against': pa, 'DVOA': dvoa, 'Variance': var} 

# Extracts the values from the dictionary and turns it into a team based listed

def extract(team):
    return list(team.values())

# Takes in the standard relative strength of both teams and calculates who has a better chance of winning

def win_probability(a, b):
    if a > b:
        a *= 100
        print('Win Probability: ' + format(a,'.1f') + '%')
    elif b > a:
        b *= 100
        print('Win Probability: ' + format(b, '.1f') + '%')
    else:
        print('Win Probability: 50%')

# Method that determines the scores based upon the teams playing

    a = (float(lista[2]) + float(lista[3]) + float(listb[2]) + float(listb[3]))/2 # Adding the points for and points against for an O/U number
    x = srsa * a # Team A percent strength times O/U number

    score2 = (y * y1) + 3 # Score prediction for team B based on the previous calculations plus 3 for home field advantage
